# ZMK Config

This is the config for my wireless zmk keyboard. 

I am currently trying to use the same keymap on two different controllers:

- The nice!nano v2, which needs ZMK for the wireless support; and,
- The ATmega32U4, (read Arduino Pro-Micro) that cannot run ZMK, as it is an 8 bit processor.

Due to the two-way incompatibility, I am currently maintaining a similar keymap in QMK.
